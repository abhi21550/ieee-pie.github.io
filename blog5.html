One has a simple thought to start something new, maybe something modified, it is the execution of this thought into a physical entity which one can call a startup. A startup is an idea of an individual or a group of individual which is turned into a palpable business model by an entrepreneur, i.e., Watch Shark Tank (Not a pretty watch but does convey the message). Startups are often defined as the most basic form an entrepreneurship takes before it becomes a full pledged business that generates heavy incomes. Most startups are found by an individual or a group. They often work without pay as they may not have a sponsor to take care of the funding. They work to fulfill their dream, to create their product into a marketable one for consumers. A startup to the founders is like their child, they want to see them grow up and become independent adults while being a functioning member of the society. A child will have their own problems while growing up as they can get diseases and other, the parent has to take them to a hospital and treat them. However the part that stands out is that a parent loves their child and likewise the founders love their ideas as well. Several great companies of our time have had humble beginnings. Apple was found by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak in the former’s mom’s garage. It is fascinating to see Apple’s growth as they have become one of the biggest tech companies in the world. However it was not a smooth ride as it was filled with bumps and bruises along the way. Jobs was kicked out of the company at times when his products failed and Apple’s value dropped. However, they found a way through as they rehired Jobs and found marketable products and slowly build up their gone reputations and have become the company we know today. A startup is like a reminder that one shouldn’t think less of their ideas and beliefs. It is something that reminds us that if one has an idea and has the passion and love for it, there is nothing stopping you from fulfilling your dreams.
           It’s like our former president APJ Abdul Kalam said “DREAM is not what you see in sleep, DREAM is something which doesn’t let you sleep”. Keep on believing and working and even the impossible can be achieved.</p>
