        <p class="align-content-center p-4"><br>Back in the 90’s, if someone announced that he had an idea and wanted to build a company based on that, he was more likely to face either a stolen idea or a complete suppression from society. But times have changed. Leaving behind all the vile parts, entrepreneurship is at its epitome right now.  We are witnessing the growth of many startups, from scratch to even a million dollar company. And for all these, the rich in our society play a vital role. So what is it like to start a startup? How can you begin a legacy that you were dreaming about for a long time? The answer lies in the history of these startups, both those who have succeeded and also those who failed.  Starting a company is actually more possible than you think. It happens a lot frequently. But only a few emerge as the public’s favourite. The first and main element of your dream company should be an idea. Many people confuse this idea with scientific papers. The only criteria for your idea is the willingness of the public to pay for your idea. That’s all. Selling tea under a brand name works because people value it. Always remember, it is the crowd you should satisfy, not the scientists.  Hard Work as it sounds, plays a hard role in forging your idea. Especially if you are trying to do it alone, all the work is one you. Only you will be responsible for the hikes and valleys your company’s going to witness. And doing hard work is easy. You just drop all the distractions around you and solely focus on your idea. Once you start the working part, you would be grateful to yourself for taking the first step.  The third should be learning. Learning is something you should do, irrespective of anything. Whether you are starting up something or doing an office job, you should learn. If you are alive, you should keep learning. It keeps our mind fresh and focused. It keeps us from making repetitive mistakes. Learning about the people you are going to sell your product will play an important part in your success story.  Fourth is not a skill but an attitude. No matter how many rejections you face, and believe me you will face a lot, you should continue creating new ideas. Persistently sticking to an off shaded idea is not always a good thing but continuously improving your previous idea or coming up with a better one can help you largely to sustain in this field.  There are many other skills like communication skill, leadership and the list goes on. 
          In the end, all that matters is whether you are happy or not. You should believe in yourself more than anyone around you and that will definitely help you find true success</p>
