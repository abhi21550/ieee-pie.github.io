        <p class="align-content-center p-4"><br>Every late teenager’s dream would be a magnificent start-up with massive cash in-flows, anything more is just icing on the cake! Isn’t it? Notable names like Elon Musk, Ratan Tata, Azim Premji, Warren Buffet and so on, would have surely been one of the driving forces for the young aspiring entrepreneurs. Having said that, let’s agree to the fact that every tom, dick and harry would have commenced a startup and probably failed at it. But if those big names could do it, can everyone do it? What startups are really like? Does everyone have an ideal entrepreneur in them? Let’s dive a little deeper and unfold the startup idea.  A startup by definition is a company or project undertaken by an entrepreneur to seek, develop, and validate a scalable business model. Nevertheless, startups are never an easy game. It involves all day-all night hustle meeting deadlines, high-end pressure raising finance and setting the fundamental business model right.  It’s evident that startups aim for a solution to an existing problem and they might go for more than one business vertical in their business model to achieve it, thereby constantly increasing their revenues. However, most of the startups fail to generate profit even after providing decent revenue in the initial six years. Profitability has been an issue for most startups and thus failing to attract investors. Although, there are controversies on the valuation of startups lately. Some analysts call for a ‘potential for growth’ to value startups, an ideal way to value in the initial five to six years, perhaps.  One of the tremendous hustle for startups is securing Series A,B,C funding and it’s vital for businesses as well. This is what turning the tables is like. You run a successful startup, you have to improve traction constantly and raise funds. This brings capital to the firm for day to day business activities and room for further expansion. However, new startups are pumped with massive debt which can be quite alarming as well, this could put startups at high risk. As a result, a run for interest coverage screams in the heart of startups, should you fail to do so with sufficient current assets to meet the current liabilities; startups die at an early stage.  
          The story of startups smashing the top line of the business would sound like a lucrative idea but the truth is, it isn’t necessarily. Most businesses fail to provide a bottom line in-spite of an attractive revenue. It seems like the good isn’t good enough to scale your business. However, one good news is, if you put your heart and soul to it; having a unique solution to an issue, raising finance, good product fit, constant increase in top and bottom line, managing working and human capital, there’s nothing that’s stopping a startup.</p>
