          The past few years have witnessed a shift  from 9-5 jobs to startups commonly  among the youngsters partly because  they do not wish to work under an  establishment and partly due to  COVID-19, but is it really worth the risk??  
          
          A study shows that 90% of Indian  start-ups fail within the first five years and  many more in the long run. So where did  we go wrong? The answer is that we need  unique business models, finding solutions  like no one has thought before, but even if  we did have one, lack of innovation and  support is another major setback faced by  entrepreneurs. One quality that every  entrepreneur needs is persistence. Owning  a start-up can cost your life. It is like a  roller-coaster going through ups and  downs. Often people are focused on  immediate gains within a month or few, 
          
          downs. Often people are focused on  immediate gains within a month or few,  but it takes time to actually get on track  and keep moving. The success rate also  depends on current circumstances for  example, the corona boomed the business  for few at th1e same time suppressed the  hopes of many.  
          
          India has numerous minds with enormous  skill sets, but we lack resources. We need  more agencies like the Kerala startup  mission to support and provide for them.  We also need to focus on promoting  women in this field because their ratio  stands at just 14%.  
          
          The primary aim of starting a business  should be to learn and not to earn. You  requires a strong sense of products,  timing , trends and markets which can  only be acquired through experience. The  perks of being an entrepreneur is that you  get to control your life, choose your own  destiny and the flexibility that comes with  it. but with the advantaaes comes the 
          
          get to control your life, choose your own  destiny and the flexibility that comes with  it, but with the advantages comes the  pitfalls. Som1etimes the wait to actually see  results could be boundless. Limited  resources, lack of funding and the  uncertainities associated with the  outcome can be challenging.  
          
          From putting your blood and soul to  working long nights, investing every single  penny you’ve got, you might be risking  your life, but with proper strategy and  commitment, the r,esults might be slow but . . promising. </p>
